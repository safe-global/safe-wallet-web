      <h3>3. What are the Services offered?</h3>
      <p>
        Our services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;) primarily consist of enabling users to create their Safes and ongoing
        interaction with it on the Blockchain.
      </p>
      <ol start={1}>
        <li>&ldquo;Safe&rdquo; </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Safe (&ldquo;Safe&rdquo;) is a modular, self-custodial (i.e. not supervised by us) smart contract-based
        wallet not provided by CC. Safe is{' '}
        <Link href="https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/" passHref>
          <MUILink target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            open-source
          </MUILink>
        </Link>
        &nbsp;released under LGPL-3.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart contract wallet means, unlike a standard private key Wallet, that access control for authorizing any
        Transaction is defined in code. An example are multi-signature wallets which require that any Transaction must
        be signed by a minimum number of signing wallets whereby the specifics of the requirements to authorize a
        Transaction can be configured in code.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Owners need to connect a signing wallet with the Safe.&nbsp;Safe is compatible inter alia with standard private
        key Wallets such as hardware wallets, browser extension wallets and mobile wallets that support WalletConnect.
      </p>
      <ol start={2}>
        <li>&ldquo;Safe&nbsp;App&rdquo;</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You may access the Safe using the Safe web app, mobile app for iOS and android, or the browser
        extension&nbsp;(each a &ldquo;Safe&nbsp;App&rdquo;). The Safe&nbsp;App may be used to manage your personal
        digital assets on Ethereum and other common EVM chains when you connect the Safe with third-party&nbsp;services
        (as defined below). The Safe&nbsp;App provides certain features that may be amended from time to time.{' '}
      </p>
      <ol start={3}>
        <li>&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Apps&rdquo;</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Safe&nbsp;App allows you to connect the Safe to third-party decentralized applications
        (&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Apps&rdquo;) and use third-party&nbsp;services such as from the decentralized finance
        sector, DAO Tools or services related to NFTs (&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Services&quot;). The
        Third-Party&nbsp;Apps are integrated in the user interface of the Safe&nbsp;App via inline framing. The provider
        of the Third-Party&nbsp;App and related Third-Party Service is responsible for the operation of the service and
        the correctness, completeness and actuality of any information provided therein. We make a pre-selection of
        Third-Party&nbsp;Apps that we show in the Safe&nbsp;App. However, we only perform a rough triage in advance for
        obvious problems and functionality in terms of loading time and resolution capability of the transactions.
        Accordingly, in the event of any (technical) issues concerning the Third-Party Services, the user must only
        contact the respective service provider directly. The terms of service, if any, shall be governed by the
        applicable contractual provisions between the User and the respective provider of the Third-Party&nbsp;Service.
        Accordingly, we are not liable in the event of a breach of contract, damage or loss related to the use of such
        Third-Party Service.
      </p>
      <h3>4. What do the Services not consist of?</h3>

        </li>
        <li>

      <h3>5. What do you need to know about Third-Party Services?</h3>
      <ol start={1}>
        <li>
          We provide you the possibility to interact with your Safe through&nbsp;Third-Party Services. Any activities
          you engage in with, or services you receive from a third party is between you and that third party directly.

          between you and the respective provider of the Third-Party Service.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          The Services rely in part on third-party and open-source software, including the Blockchain, and the continued
          development and support by third parties. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will
          maintain their support of their software or that open-source software will continue to be maintained. This may
          have a material adverse effect on the Services.
        </li>
        <li>This means specifically:</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We do not have any oversight over your activities with Third-Party&nbsp;Services especially by using

        </li>
        <li>
          We have not conducted any security audit, bug bounty or formal verification (whether internal or external) of

          of, content and your use of Third-Party&nbsp;Services, whose sole responsibility lies with the person from
          whom such services or content originated.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you access or use Third-Party&nbsp;Services you accept that there are risks in doing so and that you
          alone assume any such risks when choosing to interact with them. We are not liable for any errors or omissions

          contribute it. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with any such Third-Party&nbsp;Service.{' '}

          delivery of goods and services, financial transactions, and any other terms associated with such dealings, are
          solely between you and such persons. You agree that we shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or
          damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
        </li>
        <li>

          have a dispute with one or more other users, you release us, our officers, employees, agents, contractors and
          successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or

        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to limit the use of the Safe&nbsp;Apps to a specified number of Users if necessary to

          If you use the Safe App via web browser, the strict liability of CC for damages (sec. 536a German Civil Code)
