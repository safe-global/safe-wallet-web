      <h3 id="3">3. Your information and the Blockchain</h3>
      <p>
        Blockchains, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply &lsquo;DLT&rsquo;), are made up of digitally
        recorded data in a chain of packages called &lsquo;blocks&rsquo;. The manner in which these blocks are linked is
        chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be
        distributed all over the world (across several &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; which usually replicate the ledger) this
        means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a
        cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, by design, records of a Blockchain cannot be changed or deleted and are said to be
        &lsquo;immutable&rsquo;. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure
        (&lsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo;), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data.
        Data on the Blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke
        certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of
        Tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Wallet address, onto the Blockchain;
        this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your Wallet&rsquo;s
        Private Key.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the Blockchain using your Wallet, as well as (ii) share the
        Public Key relating to your Wallet with anyone (including us) rests with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS
        CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF
        THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE
        BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

      </p>
      <h5>Right Information and access</h5>
      <p>
        You have a right to be informed about the processing of your personal data (and if you did not give it to us,
        information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy intends to provide the information. Of course, if you have
        any further questions you can contact us on the above details.
      </p>
      <h5>Right to rectification</h5>
      <p>
        You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any incomplete
        personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of that
        information. The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you do not want us to use your Personal
        Information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or need to advise us of any changes to your personal
        information, or would like any more information about the way in which we collect and use your Personal
        Information, please contact us at the above details.
      </p>
      <h5>Right to erasure (right to be &lsquo;forgotten&rsquo;)</h5>
      <p>
        You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected;</li>
        <li>
          you withdraw your consent to consent based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;
        </li>
        <li>you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;</li>
        <li>we unlawfully processed your personal information; and</li>
        <li>erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS DELETED.
        THIS IS BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT GENERALLY
        ALLOW FOR DATA TO BE DELETED AND YOUR RIGHT TO ERASURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY ENFORCED. IN THESE
        CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS HELD BY US IS PERMANENTLY DELETED.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
        <li>Complying with a legal obligation under EU or other applicable law;</li>
        <li>The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
        <li>
          Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical
          purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
        </li>
        <li>The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing</h5>
      <p>You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:</p>
      <ol start={1}>
        <li>you contest the accuracy of the personal information;</li>
        <li>
          where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the
          unlawfully processed personal information;
        </li>
        <li>
          we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the
          establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such
        as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we
        can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.
      </p>
      <p>
        HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN, AS IT IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK, WE WILL LIKELY NOT BE
        ABLE TO PREVENT EXTERNAL PARTIES FROM PROCESSING ANY PERSONAL DATA WHICH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ONTO THE BLOCKCHAIN.
        IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL USE OUR REASONABLE ENDEAVORS TO ENSURE THAT ALL PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA HELD
        BY US IS RESTRICTED, NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, YOUR RIGHT TO RESTRICT TO PROCESSING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY
        ENFORCED.
      </p>
      <h5>Right to data portability</h5>
      <p>
        Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a
        contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, you
        have a right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and
        machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.
      </p>
      <h5>Right to freedom from automated decision-making</h5>
      <p>
        As explained above, we do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes
        place, you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as
        request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on
        your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.
      </p>
      <h5>Right to object to direct marketing (&lsquo;opting out&rsquo;)</h5>
      <p>
        You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. We will not contact you for
        marketing purposes unless:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          you have a business relationship with us, and we rely on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for
          processing (as described above)
        </li>
        <li>you have otherwise given your prior consent (such as when you download one of our guides)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us on the above details. On each and every
        marketing communication, we will always provide the option for you to exercise your right to object to the
        processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (known as &lsquo;opting-out&rsquo;) by clicking on the
        &lsquo;unsubscribe&rsquo; button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we
        use to collect your data. You may also opt-out at any time by contacting us on the below details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of
        an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients
        or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are
        necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from
        receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our
        website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.
      </p>
      <h5>Right to request access</h5>
      <p>
