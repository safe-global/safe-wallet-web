# Safe{Wallet} web app

This project is now part of the **@safe-global/safe-wallet** monorepo! The monorepo setup allows centralized management
of multiple
applications and shared libraries. This workspace (`apps/web`) is the frontend of the Safe{Wallet} web app.

Safe{Wallet} is a smart contract wallet for Ethereum and other EVM chains. Based on Gnosis Safe multisig contracts.

You can run commands for this workspace in two ways:

1. **From the root of the monorepo using `yarn workspace` commands**
2. **From within the `apps/web` directory**

## Prerequisites

Except for the main monorepo prerequisites, no additional prerequisites are required for this workspace.

## Setup the Project

1. Install all dependencies from the **root of the monorepo**:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Contributing

Contributions, be it a bug report or a pull request, are very welcome. Please check
our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) beforehand.

If you don't provide some of the variables, the corresponding features will be disabled in the UI.

### Running the app locally

From the root of the monorepo:

```bash
yarn workspace @safe-global/web start
```

Or directly from the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

> [!NOTE]
>
> From now on for brevity we will only show the command to run from the root of the monorepo. You can always run the command from the `apps/web` directory you just need to omit the `workspace @safe-global/web`.

## Lint

ESLint:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web lint --fix
```

Prettier:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web prettier
```

## Tests

Unit tests:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web test --watch
```

### Cypress tests

Build a static site:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web build
```

Serve the static files:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web serve
```

Launch the Cypress UI:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web cypress:open
```

You can then choose which e2e tests to run.
Some tests will require signer private keys, please include them in your .env file

## Component template

To create a new component from a template:

```
yarn workspace @safe-global/web cmp MyNewComponent
```

## Pre-push hooks

This repo has a pre-push hook that runs the linter (always) and the tests (if the `RUN_TESTS_ON_PUSH` env variable is
set to true)
before pushing. If you want to skip the hooks, you can use the `--no-verify` flag.
