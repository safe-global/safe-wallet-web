# 1\. Glossary {#1.-glossary}

What do some of the capitalized terms mean in this policy?

1. “Blockchain” means a mathematically secured consensus ledger such as  the Ethereum Virtual Machine, an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism, or other decentralized validation mechanisms.
   2. “Transaction” means a change to the data set through a new entry in the continuous Blockchain.
   3. “Smart Contract” is a piece of source code deployed as an application on the Blockchain which can be executed, including self-execution of Transactions as well as execution triggered by 3rd parties.
   4. “Token” is a digital asset transferred in a Transaction, including ETH, ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
   5. “Wallet” is a cryptographic storage solution permitting you to store cryptographic assets by correlation of a (i) Public Key and (ii) a Private Key or a Smart Contract to receive, manage and send Tokens.
   6. “Recovery Phrase” is a series of secret words used to generate one or more Private Keys and derived Public Keys.
   7. “Public Key” is a unique sequence of numbers and letters within the Blockchain to distinguish the network participants from each other.
   8. “Private Key” is a unique sequence of numbers and/or letters required to initiate a Blockchain Transaction and should only be known by the legal owner of the Wallet.
   9. “Safe Account” is a modular, self-custodial (i.e. not supervised by us) smart contract-based Wallet. Safe Accounts are [open-source](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/) released under LGPL-3.0.
   10. “Safe Interfaces” refers to Safe{Wallet} a web-based graphical user interface for Safe Accounts as well as a mobile application on Android and iOS.
   11. “Safe Account Transaction” is a Transaction of a Safe Account, authorized by a user, typically via their Wallet.
   12. “Profile” means the Public Key and user provided, human readable label stored locally on the user's device.

# 2\. Your information and the Blockchain {#2.-your-information-and-the-blockchain}

Blockchains, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), are made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.

Accordingly, by design, records of a Blockchain cannot be changed or deleted and are said to be ‘immutable’. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the Blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.

In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of Tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Wallet address, onto the Blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your Wallet’s Private Key.

In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the Blockchain using your Wallet, as well as (ii) share the Public Key relating to your Wallet with anyone (including us) rests with you.

IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

# 9\. Your Rights as a Data Subject {#9.-your-rights-as-a-data-subject}

You have certain rights under applicable legislation, and in particular under Regulation EU 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or ‘GDPR’). We explain these below. You can find out more about the GDPR and your rights by accessing the [European Commission’s website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en). If you wish to exercise your data subject rights, please contact us by post or at privacy@cc0x.dev.

#### Right Information and access {#right-information-and-access}

You have a right to be informed about the processing of your personal data (and if you did not give it to us, information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy intends to provide the information. Of course, if you have any further questions you can contact us on the above details.

#### Right to rectification {#right-to-rectification}

You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any incomplete personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of that information. The accuracy of your information is important to us.

* we unlawfully processed your personal information; and
* erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.

HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS DELETED. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT GENERALLY ALLOW FOR DATA TO BE DELETED AND YOUR RIGHT TO ERASURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY ENFORCED. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS HELD BY US IS PERMANENTLY DELETED.

We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:

* Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
* Complying with a legal obligation under EU or other applicable law;

* Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
* The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

#### Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing {#right-to-restrict-processing-and-right-to-object-to-processing}

You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:
